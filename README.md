MGWUTimedResourceManager
========================

This class provides an interface to add timed resources to your game.  Timed resources are scarce - they only regenerate after a certain amount of time has elapsed.  Like the lives in Candy Crush Saga or TwoDots.

MGWUTimedResourceManager is dependent on NSUserDefaults+Encryption to work, so when adding this to your project, include both MGWUTimedResourceManager(.h and .m) and NSUserDefaults+Encryption(.h and.m).
